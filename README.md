## Introduction

The **Rocket Movies** project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to manage movie data. The backend provides an API to perform CRUD operations on movie information, while the frontend enables users to interact with the data in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete movie information.
- Seamless integration between the backend API and the frontend UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
  - Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
  - Knex.js: SQL query builder for Node.js.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Styled Components: CSS-in-JS library for component styling.

## Setup Instructions
 
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eduaardofranco/rocket-movies.git

   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   # Start the backend server (from the backend repository)
   npm run dev

   # Start the frontend development server
   npm  run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3333`
   - The frontend development server will start on `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage
